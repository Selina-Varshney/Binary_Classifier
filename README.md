# Heart Disease Prediction
This project uses a heart disease dataset downloaded from kaggle, where the attribute 'target' is a binary variable:

1 = Person has a Heart Disease
0 = Person does not have a Heart disease

The dataset is then split in 80% training and 20% test data.
The code uses 4 models:
1) Decision Tree Classifier
2) Random Forest Classifier
3) KNN Classifier
4) Logistic Regression

And provides with accuracy and prediction for the disease for each model.

The code also plots:
1) Confusion Matrix
2) ROC Curve
3) Precision Recall Curve
For each model.

Finally the code compares the models and prints which model has the best accuracy.
